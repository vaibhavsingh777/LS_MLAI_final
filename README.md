# LS_MLAI_Final Project

## Project Overview

### Goal:

Design and train a transformer-based language model to predict the next word in a given text sequence.

### Core Tasks:

1. Build and fine-tune a transformer model (GPT-2 recommended)
2. Evaluate using perplexity and top-k accuracy
3. (Optional) Compare with LSTM baseline or deploy with a simple interface
